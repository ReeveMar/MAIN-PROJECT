This project is to aid in my understanding of the Django rest framework and react.js as well as improving my understanding of API use.

In this project i will be interfacing with the Spotify API in order to summarise user listening data and produce recommended songs based on that as well as provide the data in a user friendly visual, similiar
to Spotify Wrapped.

This acts as the backend with which the user can interface with using the frontend.
